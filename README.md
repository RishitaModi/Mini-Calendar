# Mini-Calendar
Welcome to the Mini Calendar repository! This project is a simple, lightweight calendar component built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Perfect for embedding in web applications, personal websites, or as a learning project for those new to web development.

Creating a mini calendar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves several steps. Below is a detailed guide to help you create a basic version of a mini calendar that displays the current month. 
We'll cover the structure in HTML, styling in CSS, and functionality using JavaScript.

1: HTML Structure
First, let's set up the HTML structure for our mini calendar

2: CSS Styling
Next, let's add some basic CSS to style our mini calendar

3: JavaScript Functionality
Now, let's add JavaScript to make the calendar interactive and display the current month

HTML: Provides the basic structure with placeholders for the calendar header, body, and navigation buttons.

CSS: Styles the calendar to make it visually appealing and responsive.

JavaScript: Handles the logic to dynamically generate and update the calendar based on the current month and year. It uses DOM manipulation to create calendar cells, handle navigation between months, and highlight the current day.

6: Testing
Open index.html in a web browser to see your mini calendar in action!

Display Current Date , Day , Month and Year
